                <h3>Created with matplotlib</h3>
                <p>We first wanted to see how many movies there are regarding time. So, it was intuitive to plot the number of movies in this dataset per year from 1998 to 2014. It appears that most of this data is from 2013. The data was generated randomly, thus the distribution should be the same all around. Therefore, itâ€™s very possible that that movies sales became hugely popular in Amazon around the year 2013. However, it is worth noting that there is a large decreasing trend in 2014, and that may be something worth investigating.  </p>

                <h3>Interactive Visualization Created with bqplot</h3>
                <p>
                    The interactive graph we created does not display well online and needs to be ran in an actual Jupyter notebook because of the package bqplot. The purpose of this visualization is to help the user understand the distribution of the movie ratings within each year inside of the dataset. Using the dropdown bar above, the user can select any of the years from 1998 to 2014 to view the specific plot for each year. In the example, we can see that in 2014, there seemed to be primarily 5-star reviews, whereas 2-star reviews were the rarest.

                <h3>Java - NodeJS - mongoDB</h3>
                <p>
                A artist-sharing (Music) android app based around matching users with similar preferences. Users that had similar musical tastes are able to recommend artists to one another. The reason behind this was that the reasons that we love artists aren't always due to the musical style but rather meaning behind songs. In this case, users can be the best way to find new music.
                </p>
                <p>
                The front-end was an Android app that allowed the user to set up a profile as well as send requests to the server to find matches based on the profile. The front-end used the LastFM API to request and store album and artist art to enhance the visuals of the app. A websocket wrapper for Java was also used to communicate with the Node.JS back-end.
                </p>
                <p>
                The Node.JS server's main purpose was to manage the mongoDB server. The node.JS server would find two clients who had matching artists and send a reply back to the clients that they were connected. Following a connection clients were able to send artist names to eachother to share music tastes.
