                <h2><b>Number of Movies per Year</b></h2>
                <p>We first wanted to see how many movies there are regarding time. So, it was intuitive to plot the number of movies in this dataset per year from 1998 to 2014. It appears that most of this data is from 2013. The data was generated randomly, thus the distribution should be the same all around. Therefore, it’s very possible that that movies sales became hugely popular in Amazon around the year 2013. However, it is worth noting that there is a large decreasing trend in 2014, and that may be something worth investigating.  </p>

                <h3>Interactive Visualization Created with bqplot</h3>
                <p>
                    The interactive graph we created does not display well online and needs to be ran in an actual Jupyter notebook because of the package bqplot. The purpose of this visualization is to help the user understand the distribution of the movie ratings within each year inside of the dataset. Using the dropdown bar above, the user can select any of the years from 1998 to 2014 to view the specific plot for each year. In the example, we can see that in 2014, there seemed to be primarily 5-star reviews, whereas 2-star reviews were the rarest.

                <h2><b>Comparison of Ratings over Years</b></h2>
                <p>Next, we wanted to dive deeper into the dataset to analyze specific variables it contains. One of the most important features of Amazon user review is how well rated a product is. The interactive plot shows some form of the ratings by years, but since the graphs are separated by the dropdown box, it’s hard to compare the results. So, we created a visualization that divides the dataset by year, and then using unique colors to analyze the distribution of the ratings throughout each year. This gives a much better representation of the actual dataset, and we can also compare to the blue bar (allpoint), which shows the total number of reviews in the dataset at that year. Through this, we can find that over the years, the number of 5-star reviews drastically increased. This could be explained by the use of bots or paid reviewers, which became more prominent as Amazon became more popular.  </p>

                <p>
                    The follow visualizations deal with the use of individual words in the dataset. We were able to extract the individual words from the dataset and then create a count of individual words within the entirety of the reviews across all users. Then, we created a word cloud that would show an effective visual comparison between all words in the dataset and show which ones stood ones stood out. We also took into consideration of stop words, and thus eliminated them since they do not contribute any meaning to the sentences. Clearly, “movie” was the most commonly used word, followed by “film”, “great”, and “one”. We can see that the majority of the words appearing in this dataset are somewhat positive, having words such as “best”, “love”, “good” appearing much more frequently than negative words.                 </p>

                <h2><b>Genres Over Time</b></h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I transformed all the words in the dataset into individual word vectors, displaying the count of each unique word for every single user. Ex: user 1 used the word “movie” 4 times, user 2 used the word “movie” 8 times, etc. Now, I have thousands of features to analyze. I wanted to find different genres within this dataset. So, I located specific genre words such as “action”, “romance”, “comedy”, etc. Then, I use those specific word vectors to create a line graph that spans from 1998 to 2014, so we can see how these genres changed over the years. As we can see, action has always been the most popular and it has become even more popular as the years increased. Family has been in the middle for most of the years, but has somehow made it to become the second most popular word in 2014.

                <br>
                <p>
                Another useful purpose of the individual user reviews is the fact that we can use them as predictors for statistical modeling. However, I wanted to consider the top occurring words and how they can potentially relate to each other. I also included a few other key words of interest. At the end, I created a new pandas data frame with 40 word vectors, and some of the original variables as well. Then, I plotted a correlation matrix, to see how closely these variables relate to each other. I made sure to include the heat map feature, making it easier to detect abnormal trends. We can see right off the bat that ‘helpful1’ and ‘helpful2’ are at a 0.9 correlation with each other, which means they are very closely correlated. We also expect to see words such as “film” and “films” to exhibit a higher correlation, which was also affirmed with the visualization. This means that there are definitely some multicollinearity in the dataset that a statistician would have to consider before building a model.
